<!-- GETTING STARTED -->

## How to use

### Installation

1. Install [Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

2. Clone the repo

   ```sh
   # Chage currently dir to Document
   # You can specify directory to any other location except "Program Files" and "Program Files (x86)"
   cd ~

   # Stable version
   git clone https://github.com/tomchang25/whisper-auto-transcribe.git
   cd whisper-auto-transcribe
   ```

     <!-- # If you want to test the unique feature in v3.1
     git clone --branch v3-alpha https://github.com/tomchang25/whisper-auto-transcribe.git whisper-auto-transcribe-v3
     cd whisper-auto-transcribe-v3
     ``` -->

3. Open webui.bat

4. Check for any errors and ensure that the final lines are correct.

   ```
   Launching Web UI with arguments:
   Running on local URL:  http://127.0.0.1:7860
   ```

5. Open your browser and go to `http://127.0.0.1:7860`

### (Optional) Command-line interface

1.  Open `enable_venv.bat`.

2.  Now, you can use the CLI mode.

    ```sh
    # Get help messages
    python cli.py -h

    # A simple example
    python cli.py mp4/1min.mp4 --output out/final.srt --model-size large --remain-tempfile

    # A batch example
    python cli.py test_mp4 --output out/batch --model-size small
    ```

### (Optional) GPU acceleration (CUDA.11.3)

1. Install [CUDA](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-11.3.0-download-archive)
2. Install [CUDNN](https://developer.nvidia.com/rdp/cudnn-archive)
3. Unistall CPU version Pytorch
   ```sh
   pip uninstall torch torchvision torchaudio
   ```
4. Reinstall [GPU version Pytorch](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally/)
   ```sh
   # on Windows
   python -m pip install torch==1.12.1+cu113 torchvision==0.13.1+cu113 torchaudio==0.12.1+cu113 -f https://download.pytorch.org/whl/torch_stable.html
   ```

<!-- Limitation -->

## Limitation

Currently, there are several restrictions on this project.

1. GPU acceleration only works on CUDA environment.

Also, if you want to use GPU acceleration, please make sure you have enough GPU VRAM.
Here is some recommended value.

| Precision | Whisper model | Required VRAM | \*Time used | Performance |
| :-------: | :-----------: | :-----------: | :---------: | :---------: |
|     1     |    `tiny`     |     ~1 GB     |    ~1/20    |  ~Disaster  |
|     2     |    `base`     |     ~1 GB     |    ~1/10    |  ~Youtube   |
|     3     |    `small`    |     ~2 GB     |    ~1/8     |      -      |
|     4     |   `medium`    |     ~5 GB     |    ~1/5     |      -      |
|     5     |    `large`    |    ~10 GB     |    ~1/2     |  ~Sonix.ai  |

\*Time used is relatived to video/audio time and test in 10 min Enlgish audio with GPU acceleration.
